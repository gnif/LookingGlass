Looking Glass |release| documentation
=====================================

Looking Glass is an open-source application that allows the use of a KVM
(Kernel-based Virtual Machine) configured for VGA PCI Pass-through
without an attached physical monitor, keyboard or mouse. This is the
final step required to move away from dual booting with other operating
systems for legacy programs that require high-performance graphics.
