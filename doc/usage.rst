.. _client_key_bindings:

Default key bindings
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

By default, Looking Glass uses the :kbd:`ScrLk` key as the escape key
for commands, as well as the input :kbd:`capture` mode toggle; this can be
changed using the ``-m`` switch if you desire a different key. Below are
a list of current key bindings:

.. _client_config_options_file:

Configuration files
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

By default, Looking Glass will load config files from
the following locations:

-  ``/etc/looking-glass-client.ini``
-  ``~/.looking-glass-client.ini``
-  ``$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/looking-glass/client.ini`` (usually ``~/.config/looking-glass/client.ini``)

All config files are loaded in order. Duplicate entries override earlier ones.
This means you can set a system-wide configuration in
``/etc/looking-glass-client.ini``, and override specific options for just
your user in ``~/.looking-glass-client.ini``, which is overlayed on top of
the system-wide configuration.

When first launched, the Looking-Glass client will create the folder
``$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/looking-glass/`` if it does not yet exist.

The format of config files is the commonly known INI format, for example::

   [win]
   fullScreen=yes

   [egl]
   nvGain=1

Command line arguments will override any options loaded from config
files.

.. _client_overlay_mode:

Overlay mode
~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Overlay Mode lets you configure various runtime options for Looking Glass.
These include:

- EGL filters
- Performance metrics options
- Debug frame damage display

(see :ref:`client_config_widget`)

You can also reposition and resize enabled widgets, like the FPS/UPS display,
and performance metrics.

Enter and exit Overlay Mode with :kbd:`ScrLk` + :kbd:`O`.
:kbd:`ESC` can also be used to exit. (see :ref:`client_key_bindings`)

Modifications done to widgets in overlay mode are stored in
``$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/looking-glass/imgui.ini``.
Please do not manually edit this file while Looking Glass is running,
as your changes may be discarded.

.. _client_config_widget:

Configuration widget
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The configuration widget is accessible through the overlay mode. The
widget has multiple tabs that allow setting a variety of modes and
parameters for Looking Glass at runtime.

Settings tab
^^^^^^^^^^^^

- *Performance Metrics*: A toggle for the performance metrics widget.
  Multiple graphs are available, and they will stack vertically.
- *EGL*: Modify EGL settings, such as the algorithm used for scaling, and
  night vision mode.

Changes in the settings tab are not persistent, and will be reset back to
their default values when the client is restarted.

EGL filters tab
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The EGL filters tab contains options for toggling, configuring, and ordering
post-processing filters. Each filter can be expanded to open its settings.
Filters can also be re-ordered by dragging them up or down. Filters are applied
from top to bottom. Keep this in mind when ordering them -- for example,
applying CAS before FSR might have different results than the reverse. Users
are encouraged to experiment with the order and parameters to achieve optimal
results. The currently available filters include:

-  *Downscaler*: Filter for downscaling the host resolution. Can be used to undo
   poor upscaling on the VM to better utilize AMD FSR (see below). The filter
   has a pixel-size setting that is used to set the effective downscaling ratio,
   and a configurable interpolation algorithm.

-  *AMD FidelityFX Super Resolution (FSR)*: Spatial upscaling filter that works
   on low resolution frames from the guest VM and intelligently upscales to a
   higher resolution. The filter sharpness is tunable, and displays the
   equivalent AMD quality mode based on the resolution difference.

-  *AMD FidelityFX Contrast Adaptive Sharpening (CAS)*: Filter that
   increases visual quality by applying a sharpening algorithm to the
   video. CAS can sometimes restore detail lost in a typical upscaling
   application. Has adjustable sharpness setting.

The filter settings and order can be saved to presets so that it can be restored
at a later time. As filter settings are usually application specific, multiple
presets can be defined for each case scenario. To save a preset, click on *"Save
preset as..."* and enter a preset name. Presets are loaded by selecting them in
the *Preset name* pull down. Presets are persistent and are stored on disk at
``$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/looking-glass/presets``.

.. warning::
   Please refrain from modifying any files under the ``presets`` folder.
   Those files are meant to be modified only by the Looking-Glass client.

.. note::
   Although presets are persistent, the client will not remember which
   preset was used last session, so a preset needs to be recalled once
   the client starts.

.. _host_usage:

Host usage
----------

By default the host application will simply work however there are some
configurable options available. While the host application will accept command
line arguments just as the client will it is more convenient to create the
``looking-glass-host.ini`` file with the desired configuration options.

This file must be placed in the same directory that the Looking Glass host
application was installed for it to be found and used by the application

.. _host_capture:

Capture interface
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. note::
  Currently we only provide support for the Windows host application, Linux
  options are not currently documented.

Currently under windows there are two capture interfaces available for use,
by default the most compatible and commonly supported interface is selected
however this can be changed via the ini file with the following configuration:

.. code:: ini

 [app]
 capture=<INTERFACE>

Where ``<INTERFACE>`` is one of ``dxgi`` or ``nvfbc``

.. _host_capture_dxgi:

Microsoft DXGI Desktop Duplication
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This interface (DXGI) is the default and most compatible capture interface for
windows, unfortunately though it does suffer from several drawbacks over other
options. DXGI capture can operate in two modes, DirectX 11 (default) or the
experimental and unofficial DirectX 12 mode.

Due to the design of Microsoft's DXGI API and the decision made to roll
hardware cursor updates into the capture stream this interface can suffer from
microstutters when the mouse is being moved/updated. This issue only affects
guest applications that make use of the hardware cursor instead of compositing
the cursor directly, as such titles that do not use a mouse (most FPV games)
are not affected.

The other drawback of this API is the overall system overhead, however this can
be mitigated by using the DirectX 12 backend. Please be aware though that this
backend is not experimental because it's new, but rather it's a slight
abuse/misuse of the DXGI API and allows us to bypass some Windows internals.

To enable the DirectX 12 backend the following configuration needs to be added
to the ``looking-glass-host.ini`` configuration:

.. code:: ini

  [app]
  capture=dxgi

  [dxgi]
  copyBackend=d3d12
  d3d12CopySleep=5
  disableDamage=false

The option ``d3d12CopySleep`` is to work around the lack of locking this misuse
of the API allows and you will need to tune this value to what suits your
hardware best. The default value is 5ms as this should work for most, lowing
it below 2ms is doubtful to be of practical use to anyone. If this value is too
low you may see screen corruption which is usually most evident while dragging
a window around on the Windows desktop.

.. note::
   Lowering d3d12CopySleep can improve the UPS however the UPS metric makes
   little sense when using the d3d12 backend as if this value is too low
   unchanged frames will be doubled up.

The ``disableDamage`` option may be needed to avoid screen corruption.  Note
that this will increase the bandwidth required and in turn the overall load on
your system.

The DXGI capture interface also offers a feature that allows downsampling the
captured frames in the guest GPU before transferring them to shared memory.
This feature is very useful if you are super scaling for better picture quality
and wish to reduce system memory pressure.

The configuration for this is fairly straightforward and is defined as set of
rules to determine when to perform this downsampling. The format is as follows:

.. code:: ini

  [dxgi]
  downsample=RULE1,RULE2,RULE3

The rules are written as follows:

.. code::

  (>|>=)(WIDTH)x(HEIGHT):(LEVEL)

The ``LEVEL`` is the fractional scale level where 1 = 50%, 2 = 25%, 3 = 12.5%.

**Examples:**

.. code:: ini

 [dxgi]
 ; Downsample anything greater then 1920x1080 to 50% of it's original size
 downsample=>1920:1080:1

 ; Downsample exactly 1920x1080 to 25% of it's original size, and anything greater
 ; then 1920x1080 to 50% of it's original size.
 downsample=1920x1080:1,>1920x1080:2

 ; Downsample anything greater or equal to 1920x1080 to 50% of it's original size
 downsample=>=1920x1080:1

.. _host_capture_nvfbc:

NVIDIA Frame Buffer Capture
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Due to the NVIDIA SDK License agreement this GPU feature is only available on
professional/workstation GPUs such as the Quadro series. It is known however
that **all** NVIDIA GPUs are capable of this as both GeForce Experience and
Steam are able to make use of it.

If you are able to make use/enable this this feature it offers lower overall
system load and lower latency capture, and does not suffer from the mouse
motion stutter issues that DXGI suffers from.

To enable it's usage use the following configuration in the
``looking-glass-host.ini`` file:

.. code:: ini

  [app]
  capture=nvfbc

If this feature is unavailable to you the host application will fail to start
and the host log will contain an error stating that the feature is not
available.

The NVFBC capture interface also offers a feature much like DXGI to allow
downsampling the captured frames in the guest GPU before transferring them to
shared memory. However unlike DXGI which is limited to fractional scaling,
NvFBC is able to scale to any arbitrary resolution.

The configuration for this is fairly straight forward and is defined as set of
rules to determine when to perform this downsampling. The format is as follows:

.. code:: ini

  [nvfbc]
  downsample=RULE1,RULE2,RULE3

The rules are written as follows:

.. code::

   (>|>=)(WIDTH)x(HEIGHT):(TARGET WIDTH)x(TARGET HEIGHT)

**Examples:**

.. code:: ini

  [nvfbc]
  ; Downsample exactly 3840x2160 to 1920x1080
  downsample=3840x2160:1920x1080

  ; Downsample anything greater then 1920x1080 to 1920x1080
  downsample=>1920x1080:1920x1080

  ; Downsample 3840x2160 to 1920x1080, or 3840x2400 to 1920x1200
  downsample=3840x2160:1920x1080,3840x2400:1920x1200

This capture interface also looks for and reads the value of the system
environment variable ``NVFBC_PRIV_DATA`` if it has been set, documentation on
its usage however is unavailable.
