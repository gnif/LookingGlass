### Errors that are not bugs

Some errors generated by the LG client are not bugs, but rather issues with your
system's configuration and/or timing. Please do not report these, but rather use
one of the above resources to ask for advice/help.

* `LGMP_ERR_QUEUE_UNSUBSCRIBED` - Failure to heed advice on things such as
using `isolcpus` and CPU pinning may result in this message, especially if you
are over-taxing your CPU.

* `Could not create an SDL window: *` - Failure to create a SDL window is not an
issue with Looking Glass but rather a more substantial issue with your system,
such as missing hardware support for the RGBA32 pixmap format, or missing
required OpenGL EGL features.

* `The host application is not compatible with this client` - The Looking Glass
 Host application in Windows is the incorrect version and is not compatible,
you need to make sure you run matching versions of both the host and client
applications.
